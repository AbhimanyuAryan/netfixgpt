        "Cassie Thomas, a 30-year-old medical school dropout, seeks revenge against those involved in her best friend Nina Fisher's sexual assault and subsequent suicide. Her quest begins when she learns that Al Monroe, the perpetrator, is getting married. Cassie spends her nights pretending to be drunk in clubs, exposing men who attempt to take advantage of her intoxication. She befriends Ryan Cooper, a former classmate, who reveals Al's upcoming wedding and persuades her to go on a date with him.",
        "Cassie confronts Madison McPhee, another former classmate and friend of Nina's, who denies Nina's rape. While Madison gets drunk, Cassie hires a man to take her to a hotel room. Madison later leaves Cassie multiple distressed voicemails. Cassie then targets Elizabeth Walker, the dean who dismissed Nina's case. Pretending to be a makeup artist, she lures Elizabeth's daughter, Amber, into her car and questions Elizabeth about Nina's case. When Elizabeth justifies her actions, Cassie tells her she dropped Amber off at a dorm with drunk male students. Cassie later reveals Amber's safety, forcing Elizabeth to confront her inaction.",
        "During another revenge attempt, Cassie accidentally runs into Ryan, whom she was supposed to meet for a date. She discovers that Jordan Green, Al's lawyer, is remorseful and on leave after realizing the harm he caused to women. Cassie forgives him, retracting her plan for revenge, and resumes her relationship with Ryan.",
        "Madison confronts Cassie outside her house, and Cassie assures her that nothing harmful occurred. Madison provides a phone containing a video of Nina's rape, revealing Ryan's presence at the party. Cassie confronts Ryan, who claims he was too drunk to remember the incident. Threatening to release the video, Cassie forces Ryan to reveal Al's bachelor party location.",
        "Posing as a stripper at the party, Cassie drugs the attendees, handcuffs Al to a bed, and reveals her identity. During the confrontation, Al breaks free, suffocates Cassie, and with the help of his friend Joe, burns her body in the woods. Cassie's parents report her missing, and the police investigate. Ryan, dishonestly framing Cassie as mentally disturbed, conceals her connection to Al's bachelor party.",
        "At Al's wedding, Ryan and Jordan receive texts from Cassie. Jordan receives a package with the video and instructions in case Cassie doesn't return. Gail, Cassie's friend and manager, finds a half-heart necklace with Cassie's name, and the police discover the matching half with Cassie's burnt remains. Al is arrested for Cassie's murder as Ryan receives a final text from Cassie, signed with her and Nina's names."

    "Production": [
        "Emerald Fennell devised the concept of the film in 2017, and sold the script to Margot Robbie's production company LuckyChap Entertainment after pitching the opening scene. In January 2019, it was announced Carey Mulligan had been set to star in the film, with Fennell directing. In March 2019, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, Connie Britton, Adam Brody, Jennifer Coolidge, Laverne Cox, Max Greenfield, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Sam Richardson, and Molly Shannon joined the cast, with Angela Zhou and Clancy Brown being added in April. Principal photography began in Los Angeles on March 26, 2019, lasting 23 days. The majority of exterior shots were filmed at Campus South, part of the Lanterman property at Cal Poly Pomona.",
        "The film production crew deliberately chose male actors who previously played characters known as good or wholesome to reinforce the idea that predators can be anyone.",
        "Fennell created \"mood boards\" to illustrate to the crew how Cassie has wildly different facets of her personality.",
        "Originally, Fennell planned to end the film at the time Cassie's body was burned, but the production's financiers balked at having a negative ending. She also considered an ending where Cassie appears at the wedding and kills the men responsible but deemed it unrealistic. She decided to have the ending where Cassie has a backup revenge plan as she felt Cassie would be thorough in her planning and she would be aware she could die. Additionally, Fennell stated that having Al apprehended at his wedding would reflect Cassie's sense of humor.",
        "The production had a budget around $10\u00a0million."

        "Promising Young Woman received highly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 427 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A boldly provocative, timely thriller, Promising Young Woman is an auspicious feature debut for writer-director Emerald Fennell \u2013 and a career highlight for Carey Mulligan.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 73% overall positive score, with 43% saying they would definitely recommend the film.",
        "Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \"B+\" and wrote \"Emerald Fennell's raucous debut, Promising Young Woman, twists its buzzword-laden, spoiler-free synopsis\u2014it's a #MeToo rape revenge thriller with bite!\u2014into something fresh and totally wild.\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang said \"The grimly multitasking finale of Promising Young Woman feels both audacious and uncertain of itself, as Fennell tries to meld a cackle of delight and a blast of fury, with a lingering residue of anguish. It doesn't all come together, though there's an undeniable thrill in seeing it come apart.\" Linda Holmes of NPR wrote that while Cassie is the film's focus, \"Fennell is saying something here, too, about men. About nice men and about men who think they're nice men, or nice enough men.\"",
        "In Variety, Dennis Harvey praised Mulligan's performance as \"skillful, entertaining and challenging\", but questioned her casting, writing that she wore her \"pickup-bait gear like bad drag; even her long blonde hair seems a put-on\". He speculated that producer Margot Robbie may have once been intended for the role instead. Mulligan criticized the comment, saying, \"I felt like it was basically saying that I wasn't hot enough to pull off this kind of ruse ... For this film, you're going to write something that is so transparent? Now? In 2020? I just couldn't believe it.\" Variety issued an apology, saying the review had been insensitive and \"minimized\" her \"daring performance\". The National Society of Film Critics defended Harvey's review and criticized Variety's apology. Harvey responded to Mulligan's comments in The Guardian: \"I did not say or even mean to imply Mulligan is 'not hot enough' for the role.'\" He pointed out that he was a 60-year-old gay man and did not \"go around dwelling on the comparative hotnesses of young actresses\".",
        "Aisha Harris of NPR stated that Cassie does not get satisfaction from her acts of revenge, something differing from characters in other thrillers where characters take revenge. A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club stated that Ryan Cooper initially is contrasted with predatory men and \"represents the possibility of forgiveness, a light at the end of the dark tunnel [Cassie has] been traveling through since college.\" In regards to why Ryan chooses to cover for his friends when the police interview him, Fennell said: \"He so wants to be good. But he's not going to blow up his own life.\" In regards to the reveal showing his true character, Dowd said: \"Even those who didn't participate are complicit for their silence, their justifications, their refusal to intervene.\" Dowd added that the casting of Burnham, who \"comes across as nonthreatening\" and has \"a boyish quality\", assisted the use of the character. Harris stated that Christopher Mintz-Plasse's portrayal of Neil had \"just the right amount of creepy, entitled energy.\"",
