        "Eight years after the events of the first film, blind Navy SEAL veteran Norman Nordstrom lives with 11-year-old daughter, Phoenix and his Rottweiler, Shadow, in a Detroit suburb. Norman tells Phoenix that her birth mother died in a fire in their old house.",
        "Hernandez, Norman's only connection with society and a veteran Army Ranger, convinces Norman to let Phoenix accompany her on an errand in town to have some time out of the house. A gangster named Raylan attempts to abduct Phoenix but is scared away by Shadow. His gang follows Hernandez's van back to Norman's where they wait for her to drop Phoenix off, then kill her when she leaves. They lure Shadow away and kill him off screen. When Norman goes outside to look for Shadow, the gang breaks in to kidnap Phoenix. A struggle ensues between Norman and the gang, and Raylan tells Phoenix that he is her real father, confirming it by showing they both have a streak of white hair.",
        "It is revealed that Phoenix's house burned down after a meth lab explosion in the basement, and Raylan had been jailed for eight years. Norman found Phoenix unconscious in the wreckage and took her home to take the place of his dead daughter. Upon release, Raylan saw Phoenix alive when she left flowers at her mother's memorial. Phoenix is chloroformed by a henchman. Raylan sets his own dog to kill Norman, who traps the animal in the attic. The gang sets the house on fire and leaves with Phoenix. Norman befriends the dog as they escape together and it leads him to the gang's hotel hideout.",
        "At the hotel, Raylan reveals Phoenix's real name is Tara and introduces her to her mother, who is alive but terminally ill. She explains that she triggered the explosion while cooking meth resulting in the poisoning of her internal organs. Tara's parents have abducted her in order to transplant her compatible organs for Tara's mother. Due to a lack of drugs and facilities, Tara will be conscious while her heart is removed. A power blackout prevents the procedure and Raylan's men are ambushed by Norman, who exploits the dark to pick them off one by one. Norman also kills the surgeon and a stray gunshot kills Tara's mother. Norman gouges out Raylan's eyes and leaves him for dead.",
        "A badly wounded Norman confirms to Tara that her father was telling the truth. He confesses his crimes, including murder and rape, and tells her to flee to safety. Raylan appears and stabs Norman, only to be fatally stabbed by Tara. She attempts to help Norman, claiming she can save him, to which he replies she already has, before apparently succumbing to his wounds. Tara leaves and heads to a children's home she had seen earlier. She approaches a group of children playing and introduces herself as Phoenix.",
        "In a mid-credits scene, Raylan's dog licks Norman's fingers which twitch slightly, indicating that he is alive."

        "In November 2016, writer Fede \u00c1lvarez announced that a sequel to Don't Breathe was in the works, and that he was set to return as director. Producer Sam Raimi called it \"only the greatest idea for a sequel I've ever heard. I'm not kidding.\" In November 2018, \u00c1lvarez discussed sequels to both his Don't Breathe and Evil Dead, saying, \"They're just ideas right now. Nothing to announce officially. We do have a script for Don't Breathe 2. That's the only difference. We don't have a script for Evil Dead 2. But we do have a script for Don't Breathe 2 that we wrote.\" He also said, \"When I tweeted that I was interested in seeing what people prefer. We were having some internal debates about what people would be interested in most. Unfortunately, Evil Dead 2 won. Which, I guess I would have preferred Don't Breathe 2 to win because it's one of my own creations. Obviously Evil Dead has the bigger following.\"",
        "In January 2020, \u00c1lvarez was replaced as director by Rodo Sayagues, the co-writer of both Don't Breathe films, making his directorial debut. In a March 2021 interview, Stephen Lang stated that in preparation for reprising the role of Norman Nordstrom, he worked with The Northeastern Association for the Blind in Albany, New York to accurately depict the mannerisms of someone afflicted with being blind.",
        "Principal photography began on August 7, 2020, in Belgrade, Serbia, with Pedro Luque serving as cinematographer, returning from the previous film. Production was previously set to begin in April 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, prior to filming, Stephen Lang quarantined himself for ten days after arriving in Serbia. Lang revealed that filming wrapped on October 8, 2020. By March 2021, post-production on the film was said to be finished, according to \u00c1lvarez, who \"watched it not too long ago,\" calling it \"fantastic,\" and later stating he thinks it's better than the first film. In May 2021, Roque Ba\u00f1os was revealed to have composed the score for Don't Breathe 2, having returned from the first film. During post-production, Jan Kovac served as lead editor."

        "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 4.90/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Stephen Lang remains a thrillingly imposing presence in Don't Breathe 2, but this sequel's story strains to find a sensible way forward for his character.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".

        "John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"Where the first film offered genuine scares, this one is suspenseful at best, snicker-worthy at worst, and will beg viewers to recall the time Fonzie got on water skis and tried not to get eaten by a shark.\" Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film a score of 1/5 stars, praising Lang as \"an effectively imposing physical presence\", but described the film as \"an unforgivably dull piece of product that should never have breathed in the first place\", and said that the antagonists were \"made as cartoonishly awful as possible\", adding: \"their ultimate plan for the girl [is] so laughably repulsive that suddenly, problematically, Nordstrom is made to seem like the better option.\" William Bibbiani of TheWrap praised Lang and Grace's performances, but described the film as \"a clunky home-invasion thriller\", adding: \"it seems more like the filmmakers wanted to purge their creation of its wickedness than tell a story about that wickedness which makes sense.\"",
        "Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club was more positive in his review of the film, giving it a grade of B\u2212. He wrote: \"Don't Breathe 2 is more effective\u2014maybe even a little mischievously insidious\u2014in its attempted villain rehab when it sticks to smaller gestures, like Norman's already established affinity for cuddly canine sidekicks.\" Christy Lemire, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film a score of 2.5/4 stars, praising Lang's performance and writing: \"the most daring feat of all in Don't Breathe 2 is its attempt to completely rehabilitate Norman. It's admirable and even unusual that a studio movie would offer such moral ambiguity in its horror hero\u2014and that's definitely what he is here, comparatively\u2014but the cause for his torment lingers until the end.\""
