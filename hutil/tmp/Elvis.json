    "Plot": [
        "On January 20, 1997, Colonel Tom Parker, former manager of Elvis Presley, has a heart attack and is rushed to a hospital in Las Vegas. Nursing a gambling addiction that has left him destitute, Parker recounts the story of how he first met \"The King of Rock 'n' Roll.\"",
        "Raised mostly by his doting mother Gladys, Elvis spends his childhood in the poorest parts of Tupelo, Mississippi, finding solace in music and the comic book adventures of Captain Marvel Jr. After moving with his parents to Memphis, he is ridiculed by his peers due to his fascination with the African-American music of Beale Street. Parker, at the time a carnival \"huckster,\" manages country singer Hank Snow but realizes Elvis' crossover potential when he hears \"That's All Right,\" initially assuming that the artist is black. That night, after witnessing his intense sex appeal at a \"Louisiana Hayride\" performance, Parker invites Elvis to accompany him on a tour and convinces Elvis to let him take control of his career, which begins Elvis' meteoric ascent: he moves from Sun Records to RCA Records, his father Vernon is appointed as business manager of Elvis Presley Enterprises, and the family is lifted out of poverty.",
        "The regional public is divided in their view of the singer. Feeling that Elvis' music will corrupt white children and stoke racial hostility, segregationist Southern Democrat Mississippi Senator James Eastland calls Parker to an informal hearing and probes his mysterious past. When Elvis flouts the authorities' warnings and performs sexually charged dance moves at a concert, he faces legal trouble. Parker persuades the government to draft Elvis into the U.S. Army instead of penalizing him. Elvis returns from basic training only to be devastated upon discovering his mother's alcohol-induced death. During his military service in West Germany, Elvis meets 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu, the teenage daughter of a United States Air Force pilot. After his discharge, he embarks on a film career and later marries Priscilla.",
        "As the popular culture of the 1960s passes Elvis by, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 devastate him. Although he wants to become more politically outspoken in his music, Parker has booked a family-friendly Christmas television special where he will only perform frivolous feel-good songs. Elvis works with Steve Binder to re-imagine the special, and his performance choices, including the closing song \"If I Can Dream,\" incorporates not only a review of his past songs but also political commentary. Infuriated corporate sponsors threaten litigation, while Parker believes Elvis has been \"brainwashed by hippies.\" Nevertheless, the show is highly successful.",
        "Afterward, Elvis headlines at the largest showroom in Las Vegas, the International Hotel, and resumes concert tours. Parker's control of Elvis' life tightens as he refuses Elvis' request for a world tour. Motivated by gambling debts, Parker manipulates Elvis into signing a contract for a five-year Las Vegas casino residency. Elvis' problematic behavior and prescription drug addiction overtakes him, and a despondent Priscilla divorces him on his 38th birthday, taking their daughter Lisa Marie with her. After discovering that Parker cannot leave the country because he is a stateless illegal immigrant, Elvis attempts to fire him. Parker subsequently informs Vernon that the family owes him an $8.5 million debt accumulated over the years and convinces Elvis of their symbiotic relationship; though the pair rarely see each other afterward, Parker continues as his manager.",
        "Increasingly exhausted after a continuously rigorous schedule of shows, Elvis expresses to Priscilla his fear of being forgotten after death, as he believes he has achieved nothing worthwhile. Parker finishes his recollection, remembering one of his final shows on June 21, 1977. In Rapid City, South Dakota, an obese and pale Elvis, unable to stand up, sings \"Unchained Melody\" and ends the performance to thunderous applause. Elvis dies a couple of months later on August 16, 1977; in Parker's estimation, what really killed Elvis was neither his heart attack nor drug-related suicide as some believe, but rather his love for his fans. At the same time, Parker also dies impoverished and alone in the hospital, having gambled away the rest of his ill-gotten fortune.",
        "A closing statement additionally explains that a series of lawsuits in the 1980s exposed Parker's financial abuse of Elvis, with Parker settling out of court and cutting his ties to the Presley estate after failing to claim immunity as a stateless person. Elvis Presley remains the best-selling solo artist in history, beloved by millions worldwide even decades after his death."

        "Steve Tisch and Gary Goodman purchased the film rights to Peter Guralnick's Elvis biography Last Train to Memphis in 1995, which would have focused on Presley's early career until his military draft. A screenplay was written by Tom Rickman as a 20th Century Fox production. In 1996, Jerry Schilling was brought aboard as a producer/consultant and Tom Parker as a technical advisor, with Elvis Presley Enterprises entering negotiations with imaging and music rights. The plan was to cast an unknown actor for the lead role. Last Train to Memphis languished in development through 2013, when Kevin Macdonald was announced as director and Mick Jagger as producer. Fox 2000 would have released the film, but the project never materialized.",
        "Baz Luhrmann's involvement was first announced in April 2014, with Kelly Marcel writing the script for Warner Bros. No further development was announced until March 2019, when Tom Hanks was cast in the role of Colonel Tom Parker. Luhrmann was set as director, and also replaced Marcel as screenwriter with Sam Bromell and Craig Pearce.",
        "In July, the frontrunners for the role of Presley were Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Austin Butler, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles; later that month Butler won the role, after impressing Luhrmann with an audition tape of himself singing \"Unchained Melody\". Luhrmann revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he got a call from actor-director Denzel Washington recommending Butler. In October, Olivia DeJonge was cast to play Priscilla Presley. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Rufus Sewell were cast as Gladys and Vernon Presley in February 2020 (though they were replaced in the film by Helen Thomson and Richard Roxburgh, respectively), with Yola cast as Sister Rosetta Tharpe.",
        "Principal photography began on January 28, 2020, in Australia. On March 12, 2020, production was halted when Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic. Filming resumed on September 23. In September 2020, Luke Bracey, Richard Roxburgh, Helen Thomson, Dacre Montgomery, Natasha Bassett, Xavier Samuel, Leon Ford, Kate Mulvany, Gareth Davies, Charles Grounds, Josh McConville, and Adam Dunn joined the cast of the film. Roxburgh and Thomson replaced Sewell and Gyllenhaal, respectively, who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts caused by the shooting delay. Kelvin Harrison Jr. was announced to be portraying B.B. King in December. In January 2021, it was reported that Alton Mason would be portraying Little Richard in the film. On May 25, 2022, Butler revealed to GQ that after filming wrapped in March 2021, he was hospitalized and bedridden for a week after being diagnosed with a virus that simulated appendicitis.",
        "On April 25, 2022, it was announced that Doja Cat would contribute an original song for the film, \"Vegas\", which incorporates elements from Big Mama Thornton's \"Hound Dog\". It was released as a single on May 6, 2022, ahead of the film's companion soundtrack album, scheduled for release that summer by RCA Records. The album also features variations on Presley material by big name artists in a variety of genres and styles. Italian band M\u00e5neskin and Kacey Musgraves are also part of the soundtrack with their respective cover versions of \"If I Can Dream\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". On May 23, 2022, rapper Eminem announced on his Instagram that he and CeeLo Green will collaborate on a new track titled \"The King and I\" which will be produced by Dr. Dre and will appear on the film's soundtrack. The full roster of artists for the soundtrack album was announced the same day with Stevie Nicks, Jack White, Diplo, Swae Lee and many more joining the lineup, along with the film's cast. Austin Butler's renditions of Presley's songs, as well as actual recordings by Presley himself, are also featured. \"The King and I\" was released on June 16, 2022, earlier than its originally intended release date. The complete soundtrack was released on June 24, 2022, entering the Billboard soundtrack chart at No. 1 on July 9, 2022.",
        "On June 12, 2022, Luhrmann revealed that when Presley sings in the film, it is Butler's vocals that are used when he is young, while Presley's vocals are used when he is older. To prove it, he released on social media an early 2019 pre-production test shoot of Butler as young Presley performing \"That's All Right\" live on set, which went viral and received an overwhelmingly positive response from viewers. Butler's vocals were blended with Presley's when he is older."

        "Elvis was released in cinemas in Australia on June 23, 2022, and in the United States on June 24, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was previously scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021, before being delayed to November 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and later to June 3, 2022. The film was not listed as part of the December 2020 announcement by Warner Bros. Pictures to debut its entire 2021 slate concurrently in movie theatres and on HBO Max, before the film was officially pushed to 2022.",

However, IndieWire reported shortly before that date that the merged Warner Bros. Discovery had decided to instead release Elvis solely to PVOD on August 9 and to Blu-ray/DVD on September 13 with HBO Max availability likely to follow in the fall. The film became available for streaming exclusively on HBO Max on September 2, followed by the HBO network premiere on September 3.",

It also opened the Guadalajara International Film Festival in Mexico on June 10 and at the Sydney Film Festival in Australia on June 15.",

Following the film's reception of its eight Oscar nominations, Warner Bros. announced its return to theaters for a limited engagement starting on January 27, 2023."

        "Butler's portrayal of Presley was widely acclaimed. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described Butler as \"a decent physical match for Elvis and a better one vocally.\" David Rooney wrote for The Hollywood Reporter that Butler \"captures the tragic paradox of a phenomenal success story who clings tenaciously to the American Dream even as it keeps crumbling in his hands.\" Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent wrote that he \"makes a compelling argument for the power of Elvis, at a time when the musician's arguably lost a little of his cultural cachet.\"",
        "On the film itself, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave it four out of five stars, calling it \"a bright and splashy jukebox epic,\" but that \"it veers in and out of fashion on a scene-by-scene basis: it's the most impeccably styled and blaringly gaudy thing you'll see all year, and all the more fun for it.\" Kevin Maher of The Times called it Luhrmann's \"best film since Romeo + Juliet ... The power in the musical numbers is drawn from Butler's turn but also from Luhrmann, who edits with the kind of frenetic rhythms that are almost impossible to resist (feet will tap) ... They are the spine-tingling highlights that make the entire project a must-see movie.\" Jim Vejvoda of IGN called it \"a dizzying and at times even overwhelming chronicle of the rock icon.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called it \"A fizzy, delirious, impishly energized, compulsively watchable 2-hour-and-39-minute fever dream \u2013 a spangly pinwheel of a movie that converts the Elvis saga we all carry around in our heads into a lavishly staged biopic-as-pop-opera.\" Joshua Rothkopf wrote for Entertainment Weekly that it \"delivers the icon like never before\" and that Luhrmann recaptured \"his Moulin Rouge! mojo with a hip-swiveling profile loaded with risk and reward.\" He went on to praise Butler's performance, saying that he \"...stares down the lens and melts it.\"",
        "Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, while praising the visuals and Butler's performance, felt mixed about the film being told from Colonel Tom Parker's perspective, saying \"I would have loved to have listened in on Luhrmann and Hanks's conversations about their ideas for the character; if nothing else, it might have explained what in the world they were after here. I honestly haven't a clue, although the image of Sydney Greenstreet looming menacingly in The Maltese Falcon repeatedly came to mind, with a dash of Hogan's Heroes.\" \nIn a review for IndieWire, David Ehrlich wrote that it \"finds so little reason for Presley's life to be the stuff of a Baz Luhrmann movie that the equation ultimately inverts itself, leaving us with an Elvis Presley movie about Baz Luhrmann. They both deserve better.\" He also criticized Hanks's portrayal of Parker, calling it \"a 'true true' performance defined by a fat suit, a fake nose, and an accent that I can only describe as the 'Kentucky Fried Goldmember'.\" On a historical note, journalist Alanna Nash, who had written an acclaimed biography of Parker in 2010, called the film a \"Baz Luhrmann fever dream\" that kept the liberties of history fair except to Parker, citing that Luhrmann's approach of presenting it through a present-day lens meant that the complicated character researched by Nash of Parker is simplified.",
        "Prior to its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis's daughter, praised the film in an Instagram post after seeing it twice, and she went on to give her thoughts on Butler's performance as her late father, stating that he \"channeled and embodied my father's heart and soul beautifully. In my humble opinion, his performance is unprecedented and FINALLY done accurately and respectfully\", while touting Butler as a frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Regarding Luhrmann's directing, she wrote that:",
        "She added that watching the film reminded her of her own son, Benjamin, who died by suicide in 2020, saying he would have loved it as well.",
        "On January 10, 2023, Lisa Marie appeared at the 80th Golden Globe Awards in support of Butler's win for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama; it was her last public appearance before her death two days later.",
        "Presley's ex-wife, Priscilla, gave her thoughts on the film, saying in full:",
        "In an interview with Today on August 16, 2022, Priscilla defended parts of the film's portrayal of Elvis and Parker's tense relationship, stating, \"I lived the arguments that they had, I lived Elvis trying to explain he didn't want to do the movies with all the girls and the beaches and everything, that he really wanted to do serious things. So living that, with him, and watching the movie, it brought back a lot of memories.\"\nOn May 21, 2022, Presley's granddaughter, actress and filmmaker Riley Keough, shared her response after viewing the film at Cannes, saying in full:",
        "At the 95th Academy Awards, Elvis was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Costume Design, and Best Film Editing.
