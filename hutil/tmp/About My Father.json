There were no further developments until May 12, 2021, when it was announced that Laura Terruso was set to direct the film and Robert De Niro was cast in a lead role. De Niro actually met Maniscalco's father, for research on playing him. American Pie's Chris and Paul Weitz were attached to produce the film alongside Andrew Miano for their production company Depth of Field. In September 2021, Leslie Bibb and Kim Cattrall joined the lead cast. In November 2021, Brett Dier, Anders Holm, and David Rasche joined the cast.",

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 36% of 86 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"About My Father finds star/co-writer Sebastian Maniscalco drawing on his own life for material -- and inadvertently proving that a funny standup routine doesn't necessarily make for an entertaining film.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an overall 80% positive score, with 51% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Matt Zoller Seitz, in a review for RogerEbert.com stated: \"De Niro, bless his heart, is the engine that keeps this refurbished jalopy puttering along for 90 minutes. There are a couple of scenes that suggest the stronger, more fascinating movie that might've been\". InSession Film's M.N. Miller called Maniscalco's film \"A culture clash farce that works because of Maniscalco's style of comedy and De Niro playing to his long-established comic strengths as a cynical curmudgeon set in his ways.\"",
        "At the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress for Kim Cattrall."
