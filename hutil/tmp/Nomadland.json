    "Plot": [
        "In 2011, Fern loses her job after the US Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada, shuts down; she had worked there for years along with her husband, who recently died. Fern sells most of her belongings and purchases a van to live in and travel the country searching for work. She takes a seasonal job at an Amazon fulfillment center through the winter.",
        "Linda, a friend and co-worker, invites Fern to visit a desert rendezvous in Arizona organized by Bob Wells, which provides a support system and community for fellow nomads. Fern initially declines, but changes her mind as the weather turns cold and she struggles to find work in the area. There, Fern meets fellow nomads and learns basic survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road.",
        "When Fern's van blows a tire, she visits the van of a nearby nomad, Swankie, to ask for a ride into town to buy a spare. Swankie chastises Fern for not being prepared and invites her to learn road survival skills; they become friends. Swankie tells Fern about her cancer diagnosis and shortened life expectancy and her plan to make good memories on the road rather than waste away in a hospital. They eventually part ways.",
        "Fern takes a job as a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campgrounds in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Also working there is Dave, another nomad she met and danced with at the desert community. When he falls ill with diverticulitis, Fern visits him at the hospital where he has had emergency surgery. They take restaurant jobs at Wall Drug in South Dakota. One night, Dave's son visits the restaurant looking for him, telling him that his wife is pregnant and asking him to meet his grandchild. He is hesitant, but Fern encourages him to go. Dave suggests that she come with him, but she declines.",
        "Fern takes a new job at a sugar beet processing plant, but her van breaks down, and she cannot afford the repairs. Unable to borrow money, she visits her sister's family at their home in California. Fern's sister lends her the money to get the van fixed. She questions why Fern was never around in their lives and why Fern stayed in Empire after her husband died, but she tells Fern that she is brave to be so independent. Fern later visits Dave and his son's family in Point Arena, California, learning that Dave has decided to stay with them long-term. He admits to having feelings for her and invites her to stay with him permanently in a guest house, but she decides to leave after only a few days, heading to the ocean.",
        "Fern returns to her seasonal Amazon job and later revisits the Arizona rendezvous. There, she learns that Swankie has died, and she and the other nomads pay tribute to her life by tossing stones into the campfire. Fern opens up to Bob about her loving relationship with her late husband, and he shares the story of his son's suicide. Bob espouses the view that goodbyes are not final in the nomad community as its members always promise to see each other again \"down the road\".",
        "Fern returns to the nearly abandoned town of Empire to dispose of the belongings she has been keeping in a storage unit. She visits the factory and the home she shared with her husband before returning to the road."

    "Reception": [
        "Nomadland grossed $3.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $35.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $39.1 million.",
        "Although Searchlight did not publicly release Nomadland's grosses, it was released in North America the same day as The Little Things, and sources estimated a gross of $170,000 from its two-week IMAX run, then $503,000 from 1,175 theaters in its wide opening weekend on February 19, for a total of $673,000.

In its second wide release weekend, it earned an estimated $330,000 from 1,200 theaters, for a four-week running total of $1.1 million.",
        "Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of 436 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A poetic character study on the forgotten and downtrodden, Nomadland beautifully captures the restlessness left in the wake of the Great Recession.\" According to Metacritic, which assigned it a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 55 critics, the film received \"universal acclaim\".",
        "Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called the film a \"powerful character study\", and added, \"Like Zhao's earlier work, Nomadland is an unassuming film, its aptly meandering, unhurried non-narrative layering impressions rather than building a story with the standard markers. But the cumulative effect of its many quiet, seemingly inconsequential encounters and moments of solitary contemplation is a unique portrait of outsider existence.\" Adrian Horton of The Guardian gave the film a positive review, stating, \"Nomadland has garnered industry praise as a likely frontrunner for the best picture Oscar ... The word of mouth is warranted.\" A.O. Scott of The New York Times similarly gave a positive review, writing \"It's like discovering a new country, one you may want to visit more than once.\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an \"A\u2212\" and said, \"director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao works magic with McDormand's face and the real world around it, delivering a profound rumination on the impulse to leave society in the dust.\" Some reviewers felt the film idealized financial despair. Critic Tim Brayton called it \"108 minutes of poverty tourism\", while WBUR's Sean Burns wrote \"Zhao has made The Grapes of Wrath without the wrath\".",
        "IndieWire's poll of 231 critics included Nomadland in its Best Movies of 2020. According to Metacritic, the film was ranked the best of 2020 by critics more often than any other. In 2021, it was included on Forbes's list of \"The Top 150 Greatest Films Of The 21st Century.\" In 2022, it ranked number 10 on Time Out's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st century So Far,\" saying that the film \"expertly stitches together realism, moments of sheer transcendence and a lightly-worn radicalism in a way that feels nothing but unpatronizing and empathetic.\" In August 2023, Collider ranked the film at number 13 on its list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" calling it \"a moving portrayal of the American nomadic lifestyle\" and praised the lead character of Fern as \"endearing ... because of her self-confidence, but it never feels like she\u2019s attempting to impose her choice of lifestyle on anyone else.\"",
        "McDormand loudly howled toward the ceiling when accepting the Oscar for Best Picture, which drew confusion from many audience members and press outlets. She went on to explain this was done to honor the films Sound Mixer, Michael \"Wolf\" Snyder, who had passed away shortly before the release of the film.",
        "Zhao and the film's success prior to and leading up to the Golden Globes and the Oscars were initially praised on Chinese social media outlets, as well as official state-controlled news media.",
        "After the Golden Globes, Zhao was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview for Filmmaker magazine, in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\". In response to the controversy, Nomadland was pulled from theatrical release by Disney China, and the 93rd Academy Awards were censored by Chinese media outlets along with all mention of Zhao or the film on social media.",
