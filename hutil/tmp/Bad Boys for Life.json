    "Plot": [
        "Isabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Detective Mike Lowrey last.",
        "In Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus's grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.",
        "Following Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike intervenes after determining the buyers intend to kill Grassie, but he fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus and Mike travel to Carver, but he is killed as they arrive. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.",
        "Captain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he convinces Mike to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the water below.",
        "AMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el fuego\" as a made-up secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.",
        "At the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and start a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike explains the truth to Armando. In a fit of rage, Armando beats on Mike, who refuses to retaliate. Armando demands the truth from his mother, and Isabel confirms that Mike is his real father. Realizing the task he spent a lifetime training for was a lie, Armando tries to reason with his mother, leading to Isabel inadvertently shooting Armando in the chest while aiming for Mike. Enraged, she attempts to shoot Mike again, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel, who falls to her death.",
        "Sometime later, Rita has been promoted to Captain, while Mike and Marcus are placed in charge of AMMO. Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, offering him a chance to earn some redemption, which he accepts."

        "Michael Bay, the director of the first two Bad Boys films, stated in June 2008 that he might direct Bad Boys 3, but that the greatest obstacle would be cost considering both Will Smith and himself demanded some of the highest salaries in the film industry. By August 2009, Columbia Pictures had hired Peter Craig to write a script for the sequel. In February 2011, Martin Lawrence stated that the film was in development.",
        "Following several delays, Jerry Bruckheimer announced in June 2014 that screenwriter David Guggenheim was working on the storyline for the sequel. Two months later, Lawrence said a script had been written and roles had been cast. The following year in June 2015, it was reported that director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film. Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a short time later in August 2015 that there were plans for two sequels, with Bad Boys 3 scheduled for release on February 17, 2017, followed by Bad Boys 4 on July 3, 2019. In early 2016, Bad Boys 3 was pushed to June 2, 2017, with no update on the release date of Bad Boys 4. Producers had planned to begin production in early 2017. Another delay surfaced in August 2016, when, to avoid competition with the upcoming DC Comics film Wonder Woman, the studio pushed the film's release to January 12, 2018. It was also revealed that the film would be titled Bad Boys for Life. In an October 2016 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lawrence said filming might begin in March 2017. In December 2016, an updated release date for Bad Boys 4 was set for May 24, 2019.",
        "Sony announced in February 2017 that the film's release would be delayed for a third time to November 9, 2018. The following month, Carnahan left the movie due to scheduling conflicts. In August 2017, Sony removed the third film from their release schedule, and later in the month Lawrence said the film would not happen.",
        "Planning resumed in February 2018 as Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were signed, after development on Beverly Hills Cop IV stalled, in place of Carnahan, and Smith and Lawrence were confirmed to reprise. Geek Worldwide reported that the third installment in the Bad Boys franchise would film from November 2018 to March 2019 in Miami and Atlanta, with the release date scheduled for January 17, 2020.",
        "In October 2018, Variety revealed that Sony was close to green-lighting the film's production. It was reported in December 2018 that Joe Pantoliano would reprise his role as Captain Howard from the previous films. Kate del Castillo joined the cast in early 2019, and it reported soon after Theresa Randle would reprise her role as Marcus' wife, Theresa, marking her first film appearance in 10 years.",
        "Principal photography began on January 14, 2019, in downtown Atlanta. Shooting also took place in Mexico City in April 2019, as well as in Miami, wrapping on June 7, 2019. Cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert shot the film with Sony CineAlta VENICE digital cameras and Panavision Primo, G- and T-Series anamorphic lenses.",
        "The film was composed by Lorne Balfe, whose new music was integrated with Mark Mancina's themes from the first film. Both trailers for the film include a remix/mashup of \"Bad Boys\" by Inner Circle (the franchise's theme) and \"Bad Boy for Life\" by P. Diddy, Black Rob and Mark Curry.",
        "The official soundtrack album to the film, Bad Boys for Life: The Soundtrack was announced by its executive producer, DJ Khaled, and released on the same day as the film. Black Eyed Peas and J Balvin recorded a song titled \"Ritmo\", released October 11, 2019, which served as a lead single for the film's soundtrack.",
        "The soundtrack also features tracks by many artists, including Nicky Jam, Quavo, Rick Ross, Meek Mill, Buju Banton, Bryson Tiller, City Girls, Pitbull, and DJ Durel."

The film went on to debut to $62.2 million in its first three days, and $73.4 million over four, the second-best opening for the holiday, behind American Sniper. It made $34 million in its second weekend and $17.7 million in its third, remaining in first place both times.",
        "The film's release in China was delayed following the country's movie theater closures that began in January 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad Boys For Life was eventually released in China on August 14, 2020, grossing $3.2 million in its first weekend. After the easing of initial restrictions in the US, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020.",
        "IndieWire described reviews for Bad Boys for Life as \"mostly positive\", while Screen Rant stated the critics were \"generally positive\".",
        "The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 76% based on 264 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Loaded up with action and a double helping of leading-man charisma, Bad Boys for Life reinvigorates this long-dormant franchise by playing squarely to its strengths.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, equivalent to the first two films. PostTrak reported an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 73% of their respondents saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"the third time really is the charm,\" and added, \"The two directors roll with ease between raucous comedy and raw drama, to considerable effect, just as they crank up the tension on any number of occasions, occasionally with palpably visceral impact.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B\" grade, calling it a \"fun, explosive, and even thoughtful action movie,\" and wrote, \"Bad Boys for Life doesn't aim to raise the bar on its genre or rewrite the blockbuster rulebook, but it's a blast watching Lawrence and Smith revisit these characters and find a sensible place for them in the current Hollywood landscape.\""
